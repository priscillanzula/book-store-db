**Bookstore Database Management System**

Designed and implemented a relational database system that efficiently stores and retrieves information for a bookstore. The system tracks inventory, customer details, orders, shipping information, and maintains relationships between various entities such as books and authors.

### Project Objective

### This database system aims to help in:

1. Designing and implementing a MySQL database for a real-world bookstore scenario
2. Creating tables with proper schema and optimal data types
3. Establishing relationships between tables to maintain data integrity
4. Managing database access with user groups and roles
5. Querying data to extract meaningful insights

### 

### Features Implemented

**.** Complete database schema with 15 interconnected tables

. Primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity

. Optimized data types (using DECIMAL for monetary values instead of FLOAT)

. Many-to-many relationship management between books and authors

. Customer address management system allowing multiple addresses per customer

. Order tracking with status history

. Shipping method integration

### 

### 

### **Tools and Technologies**

1. MySQL \- For building and managing the database  
2. Draw.io \- For visualizing the database schema and relationships

### 

### 

### 

### **Prerequisites**

To successfully complete this project, you should be comfortable with:

* Understanding the basics of MySQL  
* Creating tables in MySQL with the appropriate data types  
* Managing MySQL users and applying security best practices

### **Project Objective**

### Your goal is to build a relational database that stores information about the bookstore's operations, including books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more. You will create a database that efficiently stores all necessary data and allows for quick retrieval and analysis.

### 

### 

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Create a new database to store bookstore data.  
2. Determine the table schema and data types  
3. Write the SQL commands to create tables that match the data structure  
4. Set up user groups and roles to control access to the database  
5. Test the database by running queries to retrieve and analyze the data

### 

### **Expected Outcomes**

By completing this SQL project, you'll gain practical experience and valuable, transferable skills, including:

* Designing and implementing a MySQL database for a real-world use case  
* Creating tables with the optimal schema and data types for the dataset  
* Managing database access through user groups and roles to ensure security  
* Querying the data to extract meaningful insights

### **Tables to Be Created**

Here are the key tables that you'll design and implement for the bookstore database:

1. book: A list of all books available in the store.

2. book\_author: A table to manage the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.

3. author: A list of all authors.

4. book\_language: A list of the possible languages of books.

5. publisher: A list of publishers for books.

6. Customer: A list of the bookstore's customers.

7. customer\_address: A list of addresses for customers. Each customer can have multiple addresses.

8. address\_status: A list of statuses for an address (e.g., current, old).

9. address: A list of all addresses in the system.

10. country: A list of countries where the addresses are located.

11. cust\_order: A list of orders placed by customers.

12. order\_line: A list of books that are part of each order.

13. shipping\_method: A list of possible shipping methods for an order.

14. order\_history: A record of the history of an order (e.g., ordered, cancelled, delivered).

15. order\_status: A list of possible statuses for an order (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).
