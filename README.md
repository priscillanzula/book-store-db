### Bookstore Database Management System

Designed and implemented a relational database system that efficiently stores and retrieves information for a bookstore. The system tracks inventory, customer details, orders, shipping information, and maintains relationships between various entities such as books and authors.

### Project Objective

### This database system aims to help in:

1. Designing and implementing a MySQL database for a real-world bookstore scenario
2. Creating tables with proper schema and optimal data types
3. Establishing relationships between tables to maintain data integrity
4. Managing database access with user groups and roles
5. Querying data to extract meaningful insights

### 

### Features Implemented

1. Complete database schema with 15 interconnected tables

2. Primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity

3. Optimized data types (using DECIMAL for monetary values instead of FLOAT)

4. Many-to-many relationship management between books and authors

5. Customer address management system allowing multiple addresses per customer

6. Order tracking with status history

7. Shipping method integration


### 

### Entity-Relationship Diagram
We've included an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that visually represents the relationships between all tables in our database system. The diagram clearly shows primary and foreign keys, and how tables are connected to form a complete bookstore management system.

### **Tools and Technologies**

1. MySQL \- For building and managing the database  
2. Draw.io \- For visualizing the database schema and relationships

   
### Setup Instructions
To set up this database:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the SQL scripts in the following order:

      a.  create_tables.sql: Creates all database tables

      b.  insert_sample_data.sql: Populates tables with sample data (optional)


3. Test the database using queries.sql which contains sample querie
